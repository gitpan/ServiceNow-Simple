ServiceNow-Simple

ServiceNow::Simple provides a simplified web services interface
to ServiceNow.  Functions for query, get_records, insert and update
provide results that are more perl like and and simple to use.

One key feature is the ability to store a default user and password
so this information is not visible in every script and can be updated
in one place (it is obfuscated).  If you don't want to use this approach
that's fine as well, you can pass the user and password to the 
constructor.

There are also some nice features, like being able to define the fields
you do want returned, rather than all the fields you don't want.  This
also provides caching to improve speed.
